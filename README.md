A sophisticated AI system for Unity implementing Behavior Trees for an Ogre enemy character with:
- Multi-sensory detection (sight + hearing)
- Hyper-awareness system
- Three-stage attack patterns
- Complex animation control
- Health and damage systems

## Key Features
1. **Behavior Tree Architecture**:
   - Selector/Sequence nodes
   - Conditional execution
   - Priority-based decision making

2. **Detection Systems**:
   - 160° vision cone with chase range
   - 180° hearing detection
   - Last-known-position investigation
   - Dynamic target prioritization

3. **Combat System**:
   - 3 distinct attack animations
   - Sphere-based damage detection
   - Cooldown management
   - Player/Army unit differentiation

4. **Animation Controller**:
   - Smooth state transitions
   - Hash-based parameter optimization
   - Attack completion callbacks

5. **Health & Status System**:
   - Health bar with color transitions
   - Hurt reactions
   - Death sequence with respawn
